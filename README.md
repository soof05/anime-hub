# Anime Hub

I made this project during my journey in learning the basics of front-end developement.
For this project I have decided to use React library also I have used an anime API which is JikanApin 'https://jikan.moe/'.
In order to acheive a nice look for this app I choose ChakraUI which is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.
Through building this app I learned about several React cool features :
                                                              * useState() for managing the state of components.
                                                              * axios for connection with the back-end.
I also learned about the best practices while writing code in React, such as creating generic custom hooks for fetching data to avoid redundancy.
