# Anime Hub

<p>I made this project during my journey in learning the basics of front-end developement.</p>
<p>For this project I have decided to use React library also I have used an anime API which is JikanApin <a>'https://jikan.moe/'</a>.</p>
<p>In order to acheive a nice look for this app I choose ChakraUI which is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.</p>
<p>Through building this app I learned about several React cool features :</p>
<ul>
  <li>useState() for managing the state of components.</li>
  <li>axios for connection with the back-end.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also learned about the best practices while writing code in React, such as creating generic custom hooks for fetching data to avoid redundancy.</p>
